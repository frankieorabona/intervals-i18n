# intervals-i18n

Localisation files for [Intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu/).

If you would like to see your home language available in Intervals.icu or spot a translation that could be improved
please send me a pull request. For new languages I can do an initial Google Translate pass on the English text and
you can take it from there.

Please note that you can't add new keys or rename existing keys. Only change the values. I need to add new keys to
all files at once and make corresponding changes to the code. Also please do not re-order keys. That makes it hard
to see what has actually changed.
